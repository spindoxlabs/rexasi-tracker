This will brings up the rexasi-tracker, the RGBD detector and play a BAG file.
```
task start/example
```
You can change the default detector and use the LiDAR one by uncommenting the relative lines in the [docker compose](https://github.com/spindoxlabs/rexasi-tracker/blob/main/example/docker-compose.yaml) file.
